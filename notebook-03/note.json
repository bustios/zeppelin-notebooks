Introduction\n\n\u003e The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. -- From: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)\n\n![titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg/320px-RMS_Titanic_3.jpg \"RMS Titanic\") RMS Titanic. Image source: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)\n\n## 2. Objective\n\nThis notebook is intended to show the common steps present in a machine learning problem. For that, we are going to setup a try to predict if a person had survived to the sinking based on the information contained in the [Titanic dataset](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html).\n\n## 3. Requirements\n\nTo be able to execute the code in this notebook, it is necessary to have installed Python 3.5 and the following libraries:\n\n- Matplotlib \u003e\u003d 1.5.1\n- Pandas \u003e\u003d 0.18.0\n- Scikit-learn \u003e\u003d 0.17.1\n- Seaborn \u003e\u003d 0.7.0\n\nIf you already have installed other versions and want to maintain them and your system stability or just want to avoid problems managing dependencies, you can use [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), a reduced version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python distribution, with Python 3.5. Once installed Miniconda, you can install the libraries using the command:\n\n    conda install pandas scikit-learn seaborn\n\nThis command will install the latest versions of these libraries and will keep them along with Python 3.5 in a virtual environment completely independent of system libraries.",
